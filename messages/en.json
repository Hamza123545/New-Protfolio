        "desc": "During my undergraduate studies at the Governor House Institute, I have been honing my expertise in computer fundamentals, database principles, and software development. As a second-year student, I have developed a strong command over Next.js, TypeScript, .NET Core, and PHP, enabling me to build scalable, dynamic, and efficient applications 💻. My passion for programming challenges and collaborating on projects drives me to deliver innovative solutions and tackle complex problems with enthusiasm 🚀. Beyond academics, I enjoy learning about new technologies and dedicating time to exploring emerging trends in the tech world 🌐. Occasionally, I unwind by spending time with friends and enjoying outings 🎉.."
