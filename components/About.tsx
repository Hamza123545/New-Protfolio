          My journey as a full-stack developer started when I gained hands-on
          experience with <span className="font-medium italic">.NET Core</span> and
          <span className="font-medium italic"> Angular</span> at Aptech. After
          that, I joined Governor House GIAIC where I learned <span className="font-medium italic">Next.js</span>,
          <span className="font-medium italic"> Sanity CMS</span>, and <span className="font-medium italic">TypeScript</span>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          I had the opportunity to work on various projects, including API
          integration and the creation of dynamic components using <span className="font-medium italic">Next.js</span> and
          <span className="font-medium italic"> Sanity CMS</span>. My passion for building
          user-centric applications motivated me to enhance my skills in frontend
          development with <span className="font-medium italic">React</span>, <span className="font-medium italic">Tailwind CSS</span>, and backend integrations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          One of my major projects was Comforty Marketplace, developed during a
          hackathon. The project utilized <span className="font-medium italic">Next.js</span>, <span className="font-medium italic">Sanity CMS</span>, and third-party
          APIs like <span className="font-medium italic">ShipEngine</span> for shipment tracking. It was deployed on Vercel and tested for performance with a
          <span className="font-medium italic"> 100% Lighthouse score</span>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          My technical expertise includes building dynamic frontend components, integrating third-party APIs, and optimizing performance for better user experiences. I also enjoy working with analytics dashboards, order tracking features, and content management through <span className="font-medium italic">Sanity CMS</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy sharing my insights and experiences on platforms like LinkedIn. Outside of tech, I love exploring new technologies, mentoring others, and gaming. I believe in the power of continuous learning, resilience, and collaboration in driving impactful results in the tech industry.
